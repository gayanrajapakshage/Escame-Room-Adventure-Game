## Key Features and Objectives

### 1. **Expanded Player Interaction**
To create a more immersive and engaging experience, the project introduces a variety of **Non-Playable Characters (NPCs)** with diverse abilities and roles. Players will interact with both friendly and hostile NPCs, each contributing to the game's narrative and challenges.

### 2. **Health, Reputation, and Currency Systems**
The game introduces three critical gameplay systems:
- **Health**: Players must manage their health and make strategic decisions to maintain it.
- **Reputation**: NPC interactions will be influenced by the player's reputation, creating dynamic dialogue and consequences.
- **Currency**: Players can earn and spend in-game currency, adding a layer of decision-making in managing resources for purchases and upgrades.

### 3. **In-Game Shop**
An **In-Game Shop** allows players to buy and sell items, including “Adventure Power-ups” and other items that enhance gameplay. This system introduces new strategic elements, encouraging players to manage their inventory and make tactical choices throughout their journey.

### 4. **Improved Accessibility Settings**
In an effort to make the game more inclusive, several **accessibility features** were added, including options to:
- Adjust **volume** for audio preferences and hearing disabilities.
- Enable **color-blind modes** to accommodate players with visual impairments.
- Change the **background color** for personalized visual comfort.
